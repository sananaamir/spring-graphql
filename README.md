# Spring Boot app with GraphQL

This project is intended to give developers an intro to GraphQL-java using Spring Boot to expose the API. 

The project is still in-progress. Right now the example follows the official documentation and utilizes a list to query the data. The goal is to query data from a database instead so that the example is more practical in nature.
